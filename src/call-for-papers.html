            <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
            <p>Submissions are now open at: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MoDeL2025">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MoDeL2025</a></p>
            
            <p>The Microsoft CMT service was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support.</p>

            <p>We invite researchers and practitioners to submit high-quality original papers exploring the intersection of Modular Deep Learning and real-world applications. The workshop aims to bring together experts to address challenges posed by monolithic AI systems and promote more accessible AI ecosystems through modular approaches.</p>

            <h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
            <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modular approaches for Continual Learning and Federated Learning, enabling efficient adaptation and knowledge transfer across different tasks and settings</li>
                <li>Model merging techniques and Mixture of Experts strategies to enhance model flexibility, scalability, and efficiency</li>
                <li>Innovative methodologies for modular model editing and patching, allowing seamless updates and refinements to AI systems</li>
                <li>Development of deep libraries and frameworks that facilitate modular learning architectures and dynamic model composition</li>
                <li>Novel evaluation metrics tailored to assess the effectiveness of modular AI systems in realistic scenarios</li>
                <li>Benchmarks and case studies demonstrating the practical deployment of Modular Deep Learning techniques in various domains (e.g., model unlearning in healthcare)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
            <p>To encourage participation and foster the dissemination of new ideas, the workshop features two distinct submission tracks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extended Abstract Track (non-archival):</strong> This track provides a platform for presenting novel ideas, preliminary results, and ongoing experiments, offering an opportunity to refine research and lay the groundwork for future publications.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Papers Track (archival):</strong> Complete papers in this track will be published in the proceedings of the workshop.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paper Format:</strong> All submissions must be in PDF format following the ICIAP conference formatting guidelines. Papers should be written in English.</li>
                <li><strong>Paper Length:</strong> Full papers should be 6-8 pages (including references), and extended abstracts should be 4 pages (including references).</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymization:</strong> The review process will be double-blind, so please make sure your submission is properly anonymized.</li>
                <li><strong>Submission System:</strong> Papers should be submitted through the conference submission system: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MoDeL2025">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MoDeL2025</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Publication</h3>
            <p>All accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings, which will be included in the ICIAP 2025 proceedings published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>
